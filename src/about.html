                                The Call family has been in show business for five generations, almost 80 years. We began at the Capitol Theatre on Main Street in Brigham City, Utah. It was a family business then and it’s a family business today. Bill Call worked for his Grandpa at the Capitol Theatre just like his grandkids worked for him at the Kaysville Theatre.

                            <p>When Bill learned how to “thread” the projectors, he was required to stay in the booth the entire time the film ran. If you were a good projectionist in those days you could change the reel while keeping the words matched up with the actor’s lips, and the audience would never realize you were even in the booth. Bill watched all of the now classic movies from the tall metal stool in the projection booth.</p>
                            <p>Before Bill and Mary were married, they dated in the booth of the Capitol Theatre. Mary also worked as a ticket taker—a post she held for almost 50 years. Shortly after they married, Bill served in the Navy during the Korean War.</p>

                            <p>Once Bill and Mary returned to Utah, they purchased the Roy Theatre and ran it as a “dollar theatre” with the slogan <em>“Roy Theatre, always a dollar.”</em></p>

                            <p>Bill “discovered” the Kaysville Theatre after his car broke down and he needed to take the bus. When the bus stopped across the street, Bill saw the Kaysville Theatre sitting empty and thought, <em>“that’d be a fun theatre to own someday.”</em></p>
                            <p>Barnes Bank held the title on the theatre, which had been sitting empty for several years. After leasing it for a few years, Bill and Mary bought it outright, and we’ve been here ever since.</p>

                            <p>During the depression, Bill’s mother bought a caramel corn franchise for $100. It came with a copper kettle, popcorn table, wooden spoon, and a recipe book. Bill learned the art of making caramel corn out of that copper kettle.</p>
                            <p>Later, Bill taught his daughter-in-law Lisa how to make it. Lisa took the little caramel corn kettle and turned it into her own business: <strong>Lisa’s Passion for Popcorn</strong>.</p>

                            <p>The Kaysville Theatre was built in the late 40s and even contains a certified fallout shelter in the basement! In 1990, the family pooled resources to renovate. Auditoriums two and three were originally Frost’s drug store and a flower shop. The sloped hallway was a part of the original number one auditorium.</p>
                            <p>In the 90s, Bill and Mary established some of our best-known traditions: serving popcorn during the 4th of July parade, summer matinees, and the now famous <strong>“Gum on the Floor” clean-up trailer</strong>. We are still thrilled each time we hear the crowd shout “Eww!” back at the screen.</p>

                            <p>On September 24, 2011, Bill Call passed away. We lost a father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and one of the best movie showmen ever.</p>
                            <p>Changes in technology pushed us to upgrade. For the first time in 20 years, the theatre closed temporarily. On March 1, 2013, we re-opened with brand new digital projectors. We know this would thrill Bill, because as every great showman knows, <em>“the show must go on!”</em></p>
